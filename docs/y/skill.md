# Model Skill: Depth (Stage 2)

## Prediction Performance

The 3-panel scatter evaluation demonstrates the model's predictive agreement with measured bankfull depths across Training, Validation, and Testing sets. Points align closely along the 1:1 line without systematic under- or over-estimation across depth ranges from $0.2\text{ m}$ to $> 6\text{ m}$.

## Cumulative Distribution Alignment (CDF)

The cumulative distribution function (CDF) comparison demonstrates rigorous quantile matching between empirical field observations and machine learning predictions, accurately reproducing the continuous depth distribution of continental river networks.

## Regional Diagnostics

Stratification across **Hydrologic Landscape Regions (HLRs)** highlights how the Stage 2 model adapts across physiographic settings:

- **Perennial Humid Channels**: Strongest performance is achieved across humid plains and mountainous catchments with sustained groundwater baseflow, where depth scaling conforms tightly to downstream power-law geometry ($d \propto Q^{0.36\text{--}0.40}$).
- **Arid & Flash-Flood Regimes**: Ephemeral and playa streams with high width-to-depth ratios exhibit slightly wider variance, reflecting intermittent flow scour dynamics.

The continental choropleth map confirms spatial consistency of model skill across all 20 HLR units without regional boundaries or discontinuities.

## Stream Order Bias Analysis

![Residual Bias by Stream Order](../assets/images/y/v2.06/training_bias/bankfull_depth_m_residual_bias_by_streamorder.png){ loading=lazy }

Evaluating prediction residuals against Strahler stream orders (1 through 9) reveals a zero-centered, homoscedastic residual distribution across all reach scales, verifying that the model avoids scale bias across tributary headwaters and continental rivers.

    Training loss and validation convergence trajectories for the deep tabular neural network (`PhysicalResTabNet`) will be added upon deployment of the hybrid multi-model ensemble.
