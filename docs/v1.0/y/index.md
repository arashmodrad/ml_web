# Continental River Depth Parameterization

---

## Executive Summary

River channel depth ($Y$ or $d$) is the primary vertical dimension governing in-channel conveyance capacity, bed shear stress distribution, and sediment transport dynamics. Across continental river networks, accurate representation of in-channel and bankfull depth is severely hindered by the **missing bathymetry problem** in digital elevation models (DEMs). 

Version **v1.0** of the FEMA/NOAA-OWP channel geometry framework introduces a machine learning framework to predict in-channel and bankfull channel depths (**$Y_{\text{in}}$ at 100% AEP** and **$Y_{\text{bf}}$ at 50% AEP**) and hydraulic geometry scaling exponents across all **2.7 million+ Reference Fabric COMID stream reaches** in the Conterminous United States (CONUS).

## The Missing Bathymetry Problem

Digital Elevation Models derived from spaceborne radar (e.g., SRTM, NASADEM) or airborne Near-Infrared (NIR) LiDAR effectively capture floodplain and valley topography. However, infrared and optical wavelengths cannot penetrate open water bodies. Consequently, elevation grids represent the **water surface elevation** at the time of data acquisition rather than the true channel bed.

!!! danger "Hydraulic Consequences of Missing Bathymetry"
    Omitting in-channel bathymetry causes 1D and 2D hydrodynamic engines (e.g., HEC-RAS, NOAA NextGen FIM) to:
    
    1. **Underestimate In-Channel Conveyance Area ($A$)**: Low-to-moderate flows prematurely spill into overbank zones.
    2. **Overestimate Flood Extent and Inundation Depth**: Water levels artificially rise above natural flood thresholds.
    3. **Distort Boundary Shear Stress ($\tau_0 = \gamma R S$)**: Precludes realistic sediment transport, bed mobility, and roughness routing.

The **Functional Hydraulic Geometry (FHG)** framework solves this fundamental data gap by learning predictive relationships between hydro-environmental catchment drivers and the parameters governing channel depth across discharge regimes.

## Two Flow Regimes: In-Channel (100% AEP) vs. Bankfull (50% AEP) Depth

The v1.0 framework parameterizes channel depth under two fundamental hydrologic benchmarks defined by USGS NWIS flood frequency annual exceedance probabilities:

| Dimension | Governing Discharge | Hydrologic Definition | Training Data Derivation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **In-Channel Depth ($Y_{\text{in}}$)** | **100% AEP Discharge ($Q_{\text{100\% AEP}}$)** | 1-year recurrence interval / mean annual flow within active banks. | Extracted directly from USGS HYDRoSWOT ADCP stage-discharge rating curves at the 100% AEP flow threshold. |
| **Bankfull Depth ($Y_{\text{bf}}$)** | **50% AEP Discharge ($Q_{\text{50\% AEP}}$)** | 2-year recurrence interval ($Q_2$) channel-forming bankfull flow. | Extracted directly from USGS HYDRoSWOT ADCP stage-discharge rating curves at the 50% AEP flow threshold. |

The ML ensemble directly learns and predicts both **$Y_{\text{in}}$** (at 100% AEP) and **$Y_{\text{bf}}$** (at 50% AEP) across all CONUS reaches. In parallel, continuous At-a-station Hydraulic Geometry (AHG) power laws are fitted to the multi-flow ADCP soundings to extract the depth scaling exponent $f$, which is coupled with width exponent $b$ exclusively to derive the Dingman cross-sectional shape parameter ($r = f/b$).

---

## Theoretical Formulation: At-a-Station Hydraulic Geometry & Continuity

Following Leopold & Maddock (1953), hydraulic cross-section variables (Top Width $W$, Mean Depth $Y$, and Mean Velocity $V$) scale with discharge ($Q$) as power-law functions:

$$
\begin{aligned}
W &= a \cdot Q^b \\
Y &= c \cdot Q^f \\
V &= k \cdot Q^m
\end{aligned}
$$

### Continuity Constraints & Exponent Sum Rules

By conservation of mass for open channel flow ($Q = W \cdot Y \cdot V = (a \cdot c \cdot k) \cdot Q^{b + f + m}$), exact continuity constraints must hold:

$$
a \cdot c \cdot k = 1.0 \quad \text{and} \quad b + f + m = 1.0
$$

### Role of Depth Exponent ($f$) in Shape Parameterization

The depth scaling exponent $f$ governs the rate of vertical channel deepening with flow ($\frac{dY}{dQ} = c \cdot f \cdot Q^{f-1}$). In the v1.0 pipeline, $f$ is predicted to calculate the continuous **Dingman cross-sectional shape exponent**:

$$
r = \frac{f}{b} = \frac{1 - b}{b}
$$

where higher $f/b$ ratios indicate entrenched, steep-walled channels and lower ratios denote wide, shallow alluvial channels.

## Continental Predictions Across CONUS

Using the trained multi-tier ensemble, FHG exponent $f$, coefficient $c$, and bankfull depth $Y_{bf}$ were predicted for all ~2.77M COMID reaches across the Conterminous United States:

![Continental Reach Predictions of Channel Depth Parameters across CONUS](../../assets/images/v1.0/y/Fig3_y.png){ loading=lazy }

### Continental Geomorphic Patterns

1. **Mountainous and Headwater Systems (Rockies, Cascades, Appalachians)**:
    * Characterized by lower $f$ values and higher bed roughness, reflecting steep valley confinement and coarse cobble/boulder beds where flow energy is dissipated in turbulent resistance rather than progressive channel incision.
2. **Alluvial Lowlands and Great Plains (Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio River Basins)**:
    * Exhibit smooth downstream transitions with stable $f \approx 0.35\text{--}0.42$, indicating equilibrium alluvial regimes where depth scales predictably with cumulative discharge.
3. **Coastal Plains & Semi-Arid Southwest**:
    * Display localized variability driven by sandy, highly erodible bank materials (promoting high width adjustment $b$) versus highly cohesive clay-rich soils (promoting vertical deepening $f$).

## Multi-Tier Modeling Architecture

To overcome the limitations of individual ML algorithms, v1.0 deploys a three-tier stacked generalization framework:

    end

    end

    T1 --> VE

```

1. **Tier 1 — Best Individual Model**: Out-of-bag tuned Gradient Boosted Decision Tree (GBDT).
2. **Tier 2 — Voting Ensemble**: Blends predictions across the top 6–8 tuned models to mitigate individual algorithm variance.
3. **Tier 3 — Meta-Learner**: Learns how individual model errors vary with catchment physiography (e.g., favoring tree models in high-relief headwaters and neural architectures in low-gradient basins), delivering the highest overall skill.
