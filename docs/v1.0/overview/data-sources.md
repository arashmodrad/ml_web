# Data Sources & Quality Assurance

The **V1.0** framework integrates field-measured hydraulic geometry from the USGS HYDRoSWOT database with continental-scale environmental predictor datasets spanning hydrology, topography, geology, soil physics, and climate. This page details the source data catalogs, quality assurance workflows, hydraulic continuity fitting, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) decompositions.

## USGS HYDRoSWOT Hydraulic Geometry Database

The primary observational foundation for training and validating the hydraulic geometry models is the USGS **HYDRoacoustic dataset in support of the Surface Water Oceanographic Topography satellite mission (HYDRoSWOT)** (Canova et al., 2016).

### Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) Principles

Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) transmit high-frequency acoustic pulses (300 kHz – 3 MHz) into the water column and measure the Doppler shift of backscattered sound from suspended particulate matter. By combining acoustic Doppler velocity profiling with acoustic echo-sounding bed tracking, ADCP transects provide high-resolution cross-sectional geometry, measuring:
* **Top Width ($W$)**: Water surface width across the transect ($m$ or $ft$).
* **Cross-Sectional Area ($A$)**: Submerged conveyance area ($m^2$ or $ft^2$).
* **Mean Depth ($Y = A/W$)**: Hydraulic depth ($m$ or $ft$).
* **Mean Velocity ($V = Q/A$)**: Cross-sectional flow speed ($m/s$ or $ft/s$).
* **Total Discharge ($Q$)**: Integrated cross-sectional discharge ($m^3/s$ or $cfs$).

### Quality Assurance & Data Cleaning Pipeline

To eliminate spurious measurements and transient hydraulic artifacts, raw surveys undergo a multi-tier quality control protocol:

![HYDRoSWOT ADCP Data Quality Control and Screening Pipeline](../../assets/images/v1.0/overview/data_cleaning.png){ loading=lazy }

Key filtering criteria include:
1. **Survey Frequency**: Stations must have a minimum of 5 distinct ADCP surveys across different flow regimes to capture stage-discharge scaling.
2. **Dynamic Range**: A minimum discharge dynamic ratio of $Q_{\text{max}} / Q_{\text{min}} \ge 3.0$ is enforced to ensure valid power-law exponent estimation.
3. **Hydraulic Regimes**: Removal of stations subject to severe tidal backwater, impoundment backwater from downstream dams, or frequent morphological avulsions.

### Continuity-Constrained AHG Power-Law Fitting

Power-law curves are simultaneously optimized across all three hydraulic parameters while enforcing strict mass conservation:

![Hydraulic Geometry Power-Law Continuity Optimization Fitting](../../assets/images/v1.0/overview/ADCP_fit.png){ loading=lazy }

$$
\min_{a, b, c, f, k, m} \sum_{i=1}^N \left[ \left(\ln W_i - \ln(a Q_i^b)\right)^2 + \left(\ln Y_i - \ln(c Q_i^f)\right)^2 + \left(\ln V_i - \ln(k Q_i^m)\right)^2 \right]
$$

subject to the physical equality constraints:

$$
b + f + m = 1.0 \quad \text{and} \quad \ln(a) + \ln(c) + \ln(k) = 0.0 \implies a \cdot c \cdot k = 1.0
$$

Only stations achieving a coefficient of determination $R^2 \ge 0.60$ are retained for ML training.

### Spatial Distribution of Training Stations

The curated dataset contains **3,543 stations** situated across **1,432 distinct river systems**:

![Spatial Distribution and Gauge Density of ADCP Training Data](../../assets/images/v1.0/overview/ADCP_trainning_data.png){ loading=lazy }

Station marker sizing illustrates the clustering density of gauges within contiguous hydrographic networks. Clustered gauges allow the machine learning pipeline to evaluate spatial autocorrelation and topological continuity along longitudinal river corridors.

## Environmental Predictor Catalog (116 Candidate Features)

A comprehensive suite of **116 candidate environmental predictors** was compiled across six primary thematic categories for all 3,543 training gauge locations and continental Reference Fabric / NextGen flowlines:

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Decompositions

To eliminate multicollinearity among the 116 candidate predictors and compress thematic feature sub-domains into orthogonal predictors, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed across each environmental domain. Supplementary Figures S2 through S12 detail the scree plots, eigenvector loadings, and geographic spatial patterns:

=== "StreamCat Catchment"
    ### Catchment Landscape & Land Use PCA
    Decomposes EPA StreamCat metrics into orthogonal axes capturing urbanization/imperviousness (PC1), agricultural intensity vs. forest cover (PC2), and baseflow buffering capacity (PC3).

=== "Soil Physical Texture"
    ### Soil Texture & Hydraulic Conductivity PCA
    Decomposes POLARIS/SSURGO soil properties. PC1 aligns strongly with the clay-sand textural gradient, while PC2 represents saturated hydraulic conductivity ($K_{\text{sat}}$) and water retention capacity ($\theta_s$).

=== "NWM Flood Frequency"
    ### National Water Model (NWM 2.1) Flow Dynamics PCA
    Decomposes flood frequency return periods ($Q_{1.5}$ through $Q_{100}$) and flow duration quantiles. PC1 accounts for >85% of total flow magnitude variance, while PC2 captures hydrograph flashiness.
