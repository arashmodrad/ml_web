# Shape ($r$) Parameterization Overview

In 1D and 2D hydrodynamic routing models (such as **HEC-RAS** and the **NextGen National Water Model**), the cross-sectional shape of a river channel controls the relationship between water surface elevation, conveyance area, wetted perimeter, and mean velocity. In the **v1.0 ML Parameterization Framework**, channel cross-sectional geometry is continuously parameterized using the power-law formulation introduced by **Dingman (2007)**, derived directly from machine-learned hydraulic geometry exponents.

## Derivation of Channel Shape ($r$) from Hydraulic Geometry Exponents

In 1D and 2D hydraulic modeling, cross-sectional conveyance volume is governed by the channel shape exponent $r$. In the **v1.0 ML Framework**, $r$ is derived directly from the relationship between at-a-station depth scaling exponent $f$ and width scaling exponent $b$ ($r = f/b$) fitted from **USGS HYDRoSWOT ADCP** field measurements without requiring LiDAR bathymetry:

By linking the rate of channel widening ($b$) and deepening ($f$) with flow to the cross-sectional geometry, the ML pipeline provides physically continuous channel profiles across all CONUS reaches.

## Dingman Continuous Power-Law Formulation

Dingman (2007) parameterized symmetrical river cross-sections using a generalized continuous power-law function. The vertical height of the channel bed $z$ above the channel thalweg (assumed to occur at the channel centerline $x = 0$) is defined across the bankfull width $W^*$ as:

$$
z(x) = Y_m^* \cdot \left(\frac{2}{W^*}\right)^r \cdot x^r, \quad 0 \le x \le \frac{W^*}{2}
$$

where:

* $x$ is the lateral horizontal distance from the channel centerline ($0 \le x \le W^*/2$).
* $z(x)$ is the vertical bed elevation above the lowest point (thalweg) of the cross-section.
* $W^*$ is the bankfull top width.
* $Y_m^*$ is the maximum bankfull depth at the thalweg.
* $r$ is the dimensionless cross-sectional shape exponent ($0 < r < \infty$).

Alternatively, expressing local water depth $y(x)$ below the bankfull stage as a function of lateral coordinate $x \in [-W^*/2, W^*/2]$:

$$
y(x) = Y_m^* \left[1 - \left|\frac{2x}{W^*}\right|^r\right]
$$

### Morphological Spectrum of Exponent $r$

The dimensionless parameter $r$ defines the curvature of the channel bed and lateral bank steepness:

* **$r < 1.0$ (Convex)**: Channel bed slopes gently in the center and steepens outward, characteristic of shallow, unconfined multi-thread channels or compound bedrock sills.
* **$r = 1.0$ (Triangular / V-shaped)**: Steep V-shaped profile with zero flat bed width, typical of incised headwaters, gullies, and bedrock-confined canyons.
* **$r \approx 1.75$ (Lane Type B Stable Channel)**: The empirical threshold cross-section identified by Lane (1955) for stable alluvial channels in non-cohesive sediment under critical tractive force equilibrium.
* **$r = 2.0$ (Parabolic)**: Classical parabolic cross-section typical of equilibrium alluvial rivers in mobile gravel and sand-bed environments.
* **$r > 3.0$ (Flat-Bottomed / Trapezoidal)**: Steep vertical banks with a broad, flat bed, common in cohesive silt-clay lowland channels and urban floodways.
* **$r \to \infty$ (Rectangular / Box Channel)**: Vertical sidewalls and flat horizontal bed, characteristic of cohesive slot canyons, wooden flumes, and concrete canal conduits.

## Hydraulic Geometry Linkage: Connecting AHG to Exponent $r$

In the classical **At-a-station Hydraulic Geometry (AHG)** framework established by Leopold & Maddock (1953), channel width ($W$), mean depth ($Y$), and mean velocity ($V$) scale with discharge ($Q$) as power-law functions:

$$
W = a \cdot Q^b, \quad Y = c \cdot Q^f, \quad V = k \cdot Q^m
$$

subject to the physical continuity constraints:

$$
b + f + m = 1, \quad a \cdot c \cdot k = 1
$$

### Mathematical Derivation of $r = f / b$

For a power-law channel cross-section obeying $y(x) = Y_m^* [1 - |2x/W^*|^r]$, the top width $W(y)$ at any stage height $y$ above the bed expands according to:

$$
W(y) = W^* \cdot \left(\frac{y}{Y_m^*}\right)^{1/r}
$$

Differentiating the stage-discharge power laws with respect to discharge $Q$:

1. Lateral expansion rate: $W \propto Q^b \implies Q \propto W^{1/b}$
2. Vertical stage growth rate: $Y \propto Q^f \implies Q \propto Y^{1/f}$

Equating discharge relations reveals the stage-to-width power law:

$$
W \propto Y^{b/f} \iff Y \propto W^{f/b}
$$

Comparing exponents between Dingman's geometric power law ($W \propto y^{1/r}$) and the hydraulic geometry stage relation ($W \propto Y^{b/f}$) yields the exact fundamental physical relationship:

$$
r = \frac{f}{b}
$$
