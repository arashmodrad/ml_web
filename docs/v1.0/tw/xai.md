# TopWidth: Explainable AI & Geomorphic Drivers (v1.0)

A central objective of the v1.0 parameterization framework is ensuring that machine learning predictions are not mere statistical correlations, but physically consistent representations of fluvial mechanics ([Modaresi Rad et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1029/2024JH000173)). To interpret model behavior, quantify the contribution of each predictor, and discover non-linear environmental couplings, we utilize **TreeSHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** grounded in cooperative game theory ([Lundberg & Lee, 2017](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1705.07874)).

## Game-Theoretic Formulation (TreeSHAP)

For any given stream reach $x$, TreeSHAP decomposes the model prediction $f(x)$ into an additive sum of a base expected value $\phi_0 = \mathbb{E}[f(x)]$ and reach-specific attribution values $\phi_j(x)$ for each environmental feature $j$:

$$f(x) = \phi_0 + \sum_{j=1}^M \phi_j(x)$$

The exact Shapley attribution $\phi_j$ is computed by evaluating the marginal contribution of feature $j$ across all possible feature subsets $S \subseteq F \setminus \{j\}$:

$$\phi_j(x) = \sum_{S \subseteq F \setminus \{j\}} \frac{|S|! \, (|F| - |S| - 1)!}{|F|!} \left[ f_x(S \cup \{j\}) - f_x(S) \right]$$

This formulation satisfies four essential game-theoretic properties:

1. **Efficiency**: $\sum_{j=1}^M \phi_j(x) = f(x) - \mathbb{E}[f(x)]$ (exact sum to the model prediction delta).
2. **Symmetry**: Identical features receive identical attributions.
3. **Dummy/Null Player**: Features with zero marginal impact receive $\phi_j = 0$.
4. **Additivity**: Attributions from ensembled models sum linearly.

## Global Feature Importance & Elbow Optimization

The global importance of each hydro-geomorphic feature was evaluated across all CONUS training reaches by calculating the mean absolute Shapley value ($|\phi_j|$):

### Top 15 Predictors Ranked by SHAP Value

| Rank | Feature Name | Category | SHAP Directionality & Hydraulic Mechanism |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Bankfull Discharge** | Hydrology | **Dominant positive driver**. High $Q_{\text{bf}}$ (red dots) provides the primary kinetic energy to widen channel margins ($\text{SHAP} > +500$). |
| **2** | **NWM Flood pc0** | Flow Dynamics | First principal component of NWM 2.1 flood frequency moments; captures peak flood flashiness and multi-year flood volume. |
| **3** | **Topographic Wetness Index (TWI)** | Geomorphometry | $\text{TWI} = \ln(a / \tan \beta)$ reflects unconfined valley-floor accommodation space; high TWI promotes wider channels. |
| **4** | **Actual Evapotranspiration (AET)** | Hydroclimate | High AET in vegetated catchments modulates runoff volume and channel boundary maintenance. |
| **5** | **Arbolatesu** | Hydrography | Cumulative upstream network length; scales with cumulative discharge and sediment transport capacity. |
| **6** | **Human pc2** | Landscape | Principal component capturing anthropogenic land use, urban imperviousness, and altered floodplain connectivity. |
| **7** | **Water Table Depth** | Groundwater | Shallow water tables (high saturation) maintain wider active channel corridors; deep water tables suppress width. |
| **8** | **PET** | Climate | Potential Evapotranspiration; reflects atmospheric evaporative demand and climatic aridity gradients. |
| **9** | **Bedrock Depth** | Geology | Deep alluvial overburden allows unrestricted lateral channel migration, whereas shallow bedrock restricts widening. |
| **10** | **NWM Flood pc1** | Flow Dynamics | Second principal component of NWM flood quantiles; captures moderate-recurrence flood pulse characteristics. |
| **11** | **Totdasqkm** | Drainage Scale | Total upstream drainage area ($\text{km}^2$); fundamental scaling metric following classical $W \propto A^{0.4\text{--}0.5}$ relations. |
| **12** | **Precipitation pc0** | Climate | Principal component of continental precipitation depth and storm intensity distributions. |
| **13** | **Elevation** | Terrain | Absolute reach elevation; separates lowland alluvial rivers from steep, confined alpine streams. |
| **14** | **NWM Flood pc2** | Flow Dynamics | Third principal component of NWM flood quantiles; captures high-frequency, low-magnitude pulse dynamics. |
| **15** | **Elevation Difference** | Terrain | Reach-level relief; steep drops concentrate flow energy vertically rather than laterally. |

### Elbow Method Feature Space Optimization

As shown in **Figure 1b**, training the ML regressor across varying feature subset sizes demonstrates clear elbow behavior:

* At **116 features**, the model exhibits excess collinearity and noise, achieving $R^2 \approx 54\%$.
* Recursive feature dropping tracking validation skill concentrates predictive power into the top orthogonal predictors.
* The performance curve reaches its optimal plateau at **15 features ($R^2 \approx 81\%$)**, highlighted by the red dashed line. Removing features below 15 causes model skill to decline ($R^2 < 77\%$).

## SHAP Interaction & Dependency Analysis

To examine non-linear threshold effects, SHAP interaction values decouple the primary feature response from joint multi-variable dependencies:

#### Physical Mechanisms Revealed:

1. **Threshold at $\text{TWI} \approx 810$**:
   * For steep, narrow valleys ($\text{TWI} < 810$), SHAP values remain negative ($-50\text{ to }0\text{ m}$), indicating that structural lateral confinement prevents channel expansion even during high flow events.
   * At $\text{TWI} \approx 810$, the relationship exhibits a sharp positive transition, where valley floors widen sufficiently to allow unconstrained lateral bank migration.
2. **Amplification by Bankfull Discharge**:
   * Above $\text{TWI} > 810$, reaches with high bankfull discharge ($Q_{\text{bf}} > 500\text{ m}^3/\text{s}$, pink/red points) experience dramatic positive width adjustments ($\text{SHAP} > +50\text{ to }+150\text{ m}$), reflecting large alluvial meander belts and multi-thread active channel corridors.
