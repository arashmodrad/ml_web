# Model Skill: TopWidth (Stage 1)

## Prediction Performance

This 3-panel scatter evaluation illustrates model agreement across the independent Training, Validation, and Test splits. The alignment along the 1:1 diagonal confirms that the Stage 1 model captures bankfull width scaling over multiple orders of magnitude without systematic overfitting.

## Cumulative Distribution Alignment (CDF)

The cumulative distribution function (CDF) comparison demonstrates quantile-by-quantile alignment between predicted and measured channel widths. The close tracking across both lower quantiles (narrow headwater streams $< 5\text{ m}$) and upper quantiles (wide mainstem rivers $> 200\text{ m}$) confirms that the model preserves the true statistical distribution of continental river geometry.

## Regional Diagnostics

Performance stratified across **Hydrologic Landscape Regions (HLRs)** demonstrates consistent predictive skill across diverse physiographic provinces:

- **High-Performing Domains**: Humid and subhumid regions with permeable soils (e.g., HLR 1, HLR 14, HLR 20) exhibit superior metric scores, driven by stable baseflow regimes and well-developed alluvial hydraulic geometry.
- **Challenging Domains**: Low-relief plains and highly incised semi-arid channels exhibit slightly wider dispersion due to anthropogenic channelization, intermittent flows, and localized bedrock controls.

The continental choropleth map illustrates the spatial distribution of model performance across all 20 HLRs, confirming geographic consistency without regional artifacts.

## Stream Order Bias Analysis

![Residual Bias by Stream Order](../assets/images/tw/v2.06/training_bias/bankfull_top_width_m_residual_bias_by_streamorder.png){ loading=lazy }

Evaluating prediction residuals mapped against Strahler stream orders (1 through 9) reveals that the model maintains an unbiased zero-centered residual profile across network scales. This demonstrates that headwater reaches and expansive mainstem channels are balanced effectively during training.
